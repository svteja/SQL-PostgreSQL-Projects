/* Insights
Certain routes like GoAir Kolkata and IndiGo Chennaiâ€“Delhi have high delays (~30â€“33%), while most other routes fall between 15â€“25%.
Some airports (Kolkata, Chennai, Delhi) show consistent delays across multiple airlines, indicating systemic congestion or operational issues.
Data-Driven Suggestions
Focus on high-delay routes (>25%) for operational improvements, including crew scheduling, turnaround time, and airport coordination.*/

The top 10 busiest routes are concentrated on major metros like Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, and Bengaluru, indicating high passenger traffic and potential congestion.
Data-Driven Suggestion
Prioritize operational efficiency and resource allocation (crew, ground handling, slot management) on these high-traffic routes to reduce delays and improve on-time performance.
