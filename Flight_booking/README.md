### ✈️ Flight Booking Analysis – Insights & Recommendations
## 🔎 Key Insights

#### High-Value Passengers Drive Revenue – A small group of frequent flyers contributes disproportionately to airline revenue (top 5 passengers per airline account for 15–20% of spend).

#### Premium Classes Underutilized – Business/First class seats show lower utilization but higher revenue share per booking, indicating pricing vs demand mismatch.

#### Cancellations Hurt Profitability – Cancelled flights lead to significant revenue leakage, especially for routes with high demand (up to 8–10% of airline revenue lost).

#### Delays Cluster Around Specific Routes – Routes connecting metro hubs (Chennai–Delhi, Kolkata–Mumbai) show the highest delay percentages, hinting at congestion.

#### Passenger Retention is Competitive – Only ~45–55% of passengers stayed with the same airline year-over-year, showing customers often switch to competitors.

#### Revenue Peaks in Seasonal Months – Flight bookings spike during summer holidays and festive seasons, with cancellations also increasing in these periods.

#### Crew Pay Discrepancies Exist – Some highly experienced crew members earn below average compared to peers, risking dissatisfaction and turnover.

#### Busiest Routes Concentrated in Metros – Major cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai) dominate bookings, making them critical for operational efficiency.

#### Booking Window Behavior – Last-minute bookings generate higher revenue per ticket, but early bookings dominate volume.
