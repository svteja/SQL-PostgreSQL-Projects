              FROM doctors d2 
              WHERE d2.Specialty = doctors.Specialty);
```

    p.Gender,
    CASE 
        WHEN p.Age < 18 THEN 'Child (<18)'
        WHEN p.Age BETWEEN 18 AND 35 THEN 'Young Adult (18-35)'
        WHEN p.Age BETWEEN 36 AND 50 THEN 'Adult (36-50)'

```
### Question 12: (using view) Which hospital branches have the highest average patient spending in the past 6 months, 
   and which specialties are contributing most to that revenue
```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW branch_specialty_avg_revenue AS
SELECT
    hb.branch_name,
    s.specialty_name,
    COUNT(p.Patient_ID) AS total_patients,
    ROUND(AVG(CAST(p.Out_of_Pocket AS DECIMAL(10,2))), 2) AS avg_patient_spending,

    patients p
    JOIN hospital_branches hb ON p.Branch_ID = hb.Branch_ID
    JOIN speciality s ON p.Specialty_ID = s.Speciality_ID

    p.admission_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH)
    AND p.Out_of_Pocket IS NOT NULL AND p.Out_of_Pocket != ''
GROUP BY
    hb.branch_name, s.specialty_name
ORDER BY
    total_specialty_revenue DESC;

SELECT * FROM branch_specialty_avg_revenue
WHERE avg_patient_spending > 10000;
```
###  Question 13 : Which branch has the highest average patient spending (Out_of_Pocket) per doctor in the last 6 months of data, and what is the specialty
 with the most contribution in each branch?
```sql
WITH recent_patients AS (
    SELECT

        AND p.Out_of_Pocket != ''
),
doctor_count_per_branch AS (

WHERE specialty_rank <= 2
ORDER BY avg_revenue_per_doctor DESC;
```
###  Question 14: How can we ensure that any time a new patient is added with Out_of_Pocket expenses over â‚¹15,000, it is automatically 
  logged into a separate audit table for high-spending cases

```sql
CREATE TABLE high_spender_log (
    Log_ID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Patient_ID INT,
    Full_Name VARCHAR(100),
    Out_of_Pocket DECIMAL(10,2),
    Logged_On DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

DELIMITER $$

CREATE TRIGGER trg_high_spender_insert
AFTER INSERT ON patients
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF NEW.Out_of_Pocket > 15000 THEN
        INSERT INTO high_spender_log (Patient_ID, Full_Name, Out_of_Pocket)
        VALUES (NEW.Patient_ID, NEW.Full_Name, NEW.Out_of_Pocket);
    END IF;
END$$

DELIMITER ;

INSERT INTO patients (
  Patient_ID, Full_Name, Age, Gender, Branch_ID, Doctor_ID,
  Specialty_ID, Admission_Date, Discharge_Date, Total_Cost,
  Insurance_Covered, Out_of_Pocket
