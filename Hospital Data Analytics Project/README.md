## ðŸ“Š Project Description: Hospital Data Analytics System
This project simulates a real-world hospital network's data infrastructure, combining structured datasets (Doctors, Patients, Specialties, Hospital Branches, Monthly Revenues) to derive actionable insights using SQL Server and Power BI.

### âœ… Real-World Business Use Cases
1. Performance Monitoring of Hospital Branches
What? Track monthly revenue trends across each branch (from 2023â€“2025).

Why it matters: Identify top and underperforming branches based on revenue. Enables strategic decisions like resource allocation, regional expansions, or cost-cutting.

2. Doctor-Level Productivity & Load Analysis
What? Analyze doctor-to-patient ratios, specializations, and total cost of treatments administered.

Why it matters: Helps evaluate doctor performance, overburdened roles, and hiring needs. Supports scheduling and improves operational efficiency.

3. Patient Demographics & Care Patterns
What? Segment patients by gender, age, admission/discharge behavior, insurance vs out-of-pocket coverage.

Why it matters: Personalized care strategies and insurance partnerships. Identifies patient satisfaction bottlenecks, especially in discharge durations.

4. Medical Specialty Optimization
What? Track popularity, average consultation fees, and treatment costs per specialty.

Why it matters: Aligns services with demand. Ensures pricing competitiveness and specialty expansion decisions.

5. Missing Data & Data Quality Auditing
What? Clean and impute null or blank data using SQL logic.

Why it matters: Ensures trustworthy dashboards and analytics. Data quality is the foundation for regulatory compliance and clinical insights.

6. Revenue Forecasting & Financial Health
What? Filling gaps in monthly revenue, trendline visualizations via Power BI.

Why it matters: Enables CFOs and finance teams to forecast revenues, identify seasonal dips, and take proactive actions.
